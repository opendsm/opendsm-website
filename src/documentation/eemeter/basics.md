## Purpose

OpenEEmeter's models are developed to predict over long periods of time. 

As an example: energy efficiency interventions (modifications to a building) must be measured over the course of a year because they will likely affect the energy usage during various seasons differently. An OpenEEmeter model would therefore need to be trained on a baseline year (1 year prior to the change) and will predict what would have happened if the intervention never occurred (a counterfactual) for the reporting year (1 year after the change).
