    "# Getting started with the OpenDSM library\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook is an interactive tutorial. It walks through loading data, utilizing OpenEEmeter models, and plotting results. You'll run all the code yourself. Cells can be executed with `<shift><enter>`. Feel free to make edits to the code in these cells and dig deeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on tutorial scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes the reader has properly installed python and the OpenDSM package (`pip install opendsm`) and has a basic working knowledge of python syntax and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a walkthrough of how to use the OpenDSM package. We'll cover the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Background - why this library\n",
    "- Loading data\n",
    "- Fitting OpenEEmeter models\n",
    "- Prediction of fit models\n",
    "- Computing metered savings\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is focused on demonstrating how to use the package to run the Hourly, Daily, and Billing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Cautions\n",
    "\n",
    "[OpenDSM](https://lfenergy.org/projects/opendsm/) is an open-source library which can be used to calculate avoided energy consumption on an individual meter. It pulls weather data using `EEweather`, fits models on training (baseline) data using the `OpenEEmeter` module, predicts using those models on testing (reporting) data, and corrects models for population-level changes via `GRIDmeter`. This tutorial will focus on the OpenEEmeter portion of this sequence. OpenEEmeter is the successor of the [CalTRACK](http://www.caltrack.org/) methodology. Initially OpenEEmeter was the complete open source implementation of the CalTRACK methodology, but it has since evolved beyond the CalTRACK models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OpenEEmeter` module is built for flexibility and modularity. While this makes it easier to use the package, without following the documentation and the guidance provided, it is very possible to use the module in a way that does not comply with the approved methodology. For example, while the `OpenEEmeter` models set specific hard limits for the purpose of standardization and consistency, they can be configured to edit or entirely ignore those limits. The reason for this flexibility is to facilitate research, development, and testing of potential changes to the models. Usage of `OpenEEmeter` does not in itself guarantee compliance with the accepted methodology if nondefault configurations are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some new users have assumed that the OpenDSM package constitutes an entire application suitable for running metering analytics at scale. This is not necessarily the case. It is designed instead to be embedded within other applications or to be used in one-off analyses. OpenDSM leaves it up to the user to decide when to use or how to embed the provided tools within other applications. This limitation is an important consequence of the decision to make the models and tools as open and accessible as possible as not all users will have access to enterprise-level infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you dive in, remember that this is a work in progress and that we welcome feedback and contributions. To contribute, please open an [issue](https://github.com/opendsm/opendsm/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/opendsm/opendsm/pulls) on github.\n",

    "\n",
    "The essential inputs to OpenDSM library functions are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Meter baseline data named `observed`\n",
    "2. Meter reporting data `observed`\n",
    "3. Temperature data from a nearby weather station for both named `temperature`\n",
    "4. All data is expected to have a timezone-aware datetime index or column named `datetime`\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of the library are responsible for obtaining and formatting this data (to get weather data, see [eeweather](https://eeweather.openee.io/), which helps perform site to weather station matching and can pull and cache temperature data directly from public (US) data sources). Some samples come loaded with the library and we'll load these first to save you the trouble of loading in your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilize data classes to store meter data, perform transforms, and validate the data to ensure data compliance. The inputs into these data classes can either be [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) `DataFrame` if initializing the classes directly or `Series` if initializing the classes using `.from_series`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test data contained within the OpenDSM library is derived from [NREL ComStock](https://comstock.nrel.gov/) simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If working with your own data instead of these samples, please refer directly to the excellent pandas documentation for instructions for loading data (e.g., [pandas.read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important notes about data:\n",
    "- *These models were developed and tested using Fahrenheit temperature. Please convert your temperatures accordingly*\n",
    "- *It is expected that all data is trimmed to its appropriate time period (baseline and reporting) and does not contain extraneous datetimes*\n",
    "- *If you run load_test_data it will download the necessary files from the OpenDSM repository. This can be up to 150 MB*"
