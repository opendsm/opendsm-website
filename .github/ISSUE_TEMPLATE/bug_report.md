name: Bug report
about: A report of or request to fix an issue in the opendsm library
---

A complete bug report will help opendsm contributors to reproduce the bug and provide
insight into fixing.

Bug reports must:

1. Include a short, self-contained Python snippet reproducing the problem. You can
  format the code nicely by using GitHub Flavored Markdown:

    ```python
    >>> import opendsm
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> meter_data = pd.DataFrame({"start": ..., "value": ...})
    >>> opendsm.get_baseline_data(meter_data)
    ...
    ```

2. Include the full version string of opendsm, pandas, and their dependencies. You can
  use the built-in function:

    ```python
    >>> import opendsm
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> opendsm.get_version()
    >>> pd.show_versions()
    ```
3. Explain why the current behavior is wrong/not desired and what you expect instead.
